					I’m a fun-loving guy and a senior studying business at BYU.
					My friends would probably describe me as goofy but somehow I
					always end up being the responsible one. I have a lot of hobbies
					to keep up with. At the moment I’m focused on softball and fishing.
					One helps me get out and be social and the other helps me get away
					from it all. If you don’t mind a little bit of a goof,
					we could be a pretty good pair.

					You know that person in your group of friends who is always planning something
					but maybe gets a little too crazy about it sometimes? Well, that’s me. I’m an
					event planner by trade and love everything about it. Putting together experiences
					for people is great, but I like to create my own too! Perfect dates are going for
					a hike, followed by a visit to the new local restaurant or taking a walk around town.
					I work hard during the week, fill my weekends with activities,
					and definitely can be a big ball of energy at times. I’m looking for a guy who loves Christ
					and loves living life to the fullest.

					I’m a creature of contradictions — An athletic bookworm, a night owl
					who’s an early riser, and an active guy who loves to read the Ensign on Sunday
					night. I’m always interested in learning new things whether it’s history,
					politics, or the guitar. (I started teaching myself piano last year and am
					loving the challenge so far.) I can also cook a mean baked tilapia or spaghetti
					dinner. Let me know if you’re interested or just give me some tips on my red sauce.

					Star Wars. Adventures. Fancy Cheese. If you like any of these three things,
					we’ll get along great. If you like all three, you could just be the love of my life.
					Either way, I’m a fun-loving girl who’s new to Utah and looking to meet some nice
					people. If you’d like to get together sometime, send me your favorite Star Wars quote
					and we can start chatting.
